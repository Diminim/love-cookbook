LÖVE cookbook is a community project dedicated to make developing in the LÖVE game framework easier by providing useful guides, tutorials, etc.

The cookbook is split up into different sections, aiming to introduce you to basic concepts of Lua (the language LÖVE uses), the basics of using LÖVE, then go through various game design concepts.  
There are also chapters on exporting your finished game, doing advanced rendering with shaders, and specific recipes to get you setup with a specific concept, like using Steam's API.

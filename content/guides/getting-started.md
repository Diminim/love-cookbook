## What is the *LÖVE Cookbook*?
If you came here from the LÖVE community, then you will probably know what this is made for. If you just found this, then **no**, the *LÖVE Cookbook* is not a guide to help you in love.

But, jokes aside, the LÖVE Cookbook (or LÖVE cookbook) is a series of guides, articles, etc. talking about the [LÖVE game engine](https://love2d.org) and how to use it. It talks about the basics and the advanced, and also even explains the basics of [Lua](https://lua.org)!

## Now, where should i start?
To read the complete book, you might take two paths:
- If you know how to code in Lua, start by going to the *Installation* page. 
- If you don't know how to code in Lua, go to the *Lua* section.

Wait! Don't go yet, there are some things about the LÖVE Cookbook you have to know first:
- It doesn't teach you game development. If you want to learn that, there are a lot of fantastic articles, cookbooks and videos talking about it!
- It is completely open source, so you can contribute to it if you want. To contribute, read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` in [the repository](https://github.com/Diminim/love-cookbook/).

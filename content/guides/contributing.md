## How can i contribute?
So, if you read the LÃ–VE cookbook you might want to make some new page or correct some grammar error.

To contribute, you first need to [fork the repository](#fork).
## Fork
> [!NOTE]
> To fork the repository you need to have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

First, go to [the repository](https://github.com/Diminim/love-cookbook) and press this button:
![[fork.png]]
This will create a new repository in your account called `love-cookbook`, now go to this repository.

When you are there, create/modify the files you want to and [create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request).
## Create a pull request
Now that you have all the necessary changes, you are gonna create a *"pull request"*.

Go to your repository and press this button 
![[contribute_button.png]]
This will create a new pull request. Make a nice title and description and press the green button to create your pull request.

Now you just have to wait for it to be merged. If it isn't merged, read comments/reviews to see what you did wrong.

After it being merged, the changes will be present in the cookbook and the pull request will be closed.

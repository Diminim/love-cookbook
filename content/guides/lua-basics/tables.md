**Tables** are a type of value in which you can store multiple values. We create a table by using curly braces.

```lua
local fruits = {}
```

Now that we have a table, we can fill it with values. There are multiple ways to do this. We can put in the values as we create the table.

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }
```

Or we can use `table.insert(table, value)`. The first argument we pass is the table, and the second argument is the value you want to insert.

```lua
local fruits = {}

table.insert(fruits, "apple")
table.insert(fruits, "pear")
table.insert(fruits, "tomato")
```

If you print `fruits`, you will see something like this:

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }
print(fruits) -- Output: table: 0x02b857e46f68
```

`table: 0x02b857e46f68` tells us that this is a table, and where in your memory it is located. That is not very useful to us. We want to know what is *inside* the table.

Our table is like a sequence, or a list. Instead of printing the entire table, let's print the first item in the list. We can do this by using square brackets.

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }
print(fruits[1]) -- Output: "apple"
```

The number at which an item is stored is called the <ins>index</ins>. So `"apple"` is on the first index.

If we want to print all the values, we *could* print them one by one.

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }
print(fruits[1]) -- Output: "apple"
print(fruits[2]) -- Output: "pear"
print(fruits[3]) -- Output: "tomato"
```

But this is very inefficient. Imagine if we had a hundred items. Luckily, there is a better way.

## For-loops

A **for-loop** is a type of statement that allows you to repeat certain code a number of times.

```lua
for i = 1, 10 do
    print("Hello!") -- Output: Hello! (x10)
end
```

This for-loop repeats 10 times. A single repetition is called an <ins>iteration</ins>.

An if-statement asks for one parameter, a condition. A for-loop asks for two parameters, separated by a comma.

> [!NOTE]
> "Parameter" here is not to be confused with function parameters. In this context it means what we provide to the statement.

* With `i = 1`, the `i` is the variable we will be using, and `1` is the starting number.
* `10` is the number up to which the for-loop will repeat.

The variable `i` will increase by 1 for each iteration

```lua
for i = 1, 3 do
    print(i) -- Output: 1, 2, 3
end
```

Because `i` is a variable, we can name it whatever we want.

```lua
for whale = 4, 8 do
    print(whale) -- Output: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
end
```

> [!TIP]
> There is a third, optional parameter. This sets by how much the variable `i` increases.
> ```lua
> for i = -5, 20, 5 do
>     print(i) -- Output: -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20
> end

The variable is only available inside the for-loop.

```lua
for i = 1, 5 do
    print(i) -- Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
end

print(i) -- Output: nil
```

### While-loops

{% abstract "A while-loop is a loop that keeps looping as long as the provided condition is true." %}

Besides the for-loops there is also a **while-loop**. It's like an if-statement and for-loop combined.

```lua
local a = 0

while a < 5 do
    a = a + 1
    print(a) -- Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
end
```

The loop repeats as long as the condition is true.

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful! If the condition never becomes false, the while-loop will repeat indefinitely, causing LÃ–VE to hang.

It is possible to exit a loop early by using a `break`. It's somewhat similar to how you exit a function with `return`.

```lua
local a = 0

while true do
    a = a + 1
    print(a) -- Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

    if a > 5 then
        break
    end
end

print("Escaped the infinite loop!")
```

A for-loop is useful when you know how many steps to take. A while-loop is useful when you know the end condition. For example, what if we want to calculate the power-of-2-sequence up to a million? We don't know how many steps it will take, but we do know when we want to end it.

```lua
local a = 1

while a < 1000000 do
    a = a * 2
    print(a) -- Output: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, .... 524288, 1048576
end
```

There is one more type of loop. A **repeat-until loop**.

```lua
local x = 0

repeat
    x = x + 1
until x > 5
```

It's similar to a while loop, except it always executes what's inside the loop at least once.

> [!NOTE]
> Even if we won't use these alternative loops as much, it's good to know of their existence.

## Looping through tables

Now that we understand for-loops, we can use them to loop through our table.

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }

for i = 1, 3 do
    print(fruits[i]) -- Output: apple, pear, tomato
end
```

Now, even if we have a hundred items, we can go over them with ease.

We can get the number of items in our table by using a number sign. We can use this to dynamically set how often the for-loop should repeat.

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }

print(#fruits) -- Output: 3

for i = 1, #fruits do
    print(fruits[i]) -- Output: apple, pear, tomato
end
```

### ipairs

Because looping through a table is so common, Lua provides a shortcut for this. Using a <ins>for-in</ins> loop, and the standard function `ipairs` we can do the following:

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }

for i, v in ipairs(fruits) do
    print(i, v)
end

-- Output:
-- 1, apple
-- 2, pear
-- 3, tomato
```

This is the equivalent to:

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }

for i = 1, #fruits do
    local v = fruits[i]
    print(i, v)
end
```

The variable `i` becomes the index of that iteration, and the variable `v` becomes the value on that index.

> [!TIP]
> Again, `i` and `v` are variables, so we can name them whatever we want.
> ```lua
> for index, value of ipairs(fruits) do
> ```

## unpack

With the function `unpack` we can "unpack" a table.

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }
print(unpack(fruits)) -- Output: apple, pear, tomato
```

We can use it to clone a table for example.

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }
local fruits_clone = { unpack(fruits) }
print(fruits_clone[2]) -- Output: pear
```

Or to assign the contents of the table to individual variables.

```lua
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }
local fruit1, fruit2, fruit3 = unpack(fruits)
print(fruit2) -- Output: pear
```


## Editing tables

We have already learned that we can use `table.insert(table, value)` to insert a value into our table. Similarly, we can use `table.remove(table, index)` to remove a value.

```lua 3
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }

table.remove(fruits, 2) -- This removes "pear"

for i, v in ipairs(fruits) do
    print(v) -- Output: apple, tomato
end
```

We can edit a value, by referring to that value's index.

```lua 4
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }

-- Change the value on the second index to "banana".
fruits[2] = "banana"

for i, v in ipairs(fruits) do
    print(v) -- Output: apple, banana, tomato
end
```

This is also yet another way to add a value to our table.

```lua 4
local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }

-- Change the value on the fourth index to "banana".
fruits[4] = "banana"

for i, v in ipairs(fruits) do
    print(v) -- Output: apple, pear, tomato, banana
end
```

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful when you set a value this way. If you leave a gap in the sequence, then Lua will be confused about how many items are in your table.
> ```lua
> local fruits = { "apple", "pear", "tomato" }
> fruits[10] = "banana"
> print(#fruits) -- Output: 3
> ```


## Objects

{% abstract "Objects are tables that use keys rather than indexes. We call these the object's properties." %}

Tables can be used as a list, where we use numbers as indexes, but we can also use strings as indexes.

```lua
local rectangle = {}
rectangle["width"] = 50
```

When using a string as the index, we call that a <ins>property</ins>. This property has `"width"` as its <ins>key</ins>, and `50` as its <ins>value</ins>.

A table with properties is also called an **Object**.

A shorter way to assign a property is to use a dot.

```lua
local rectangle = {}

rectangle.width = 50
print(rectangle.width) -- 50

-- We can still access it with the string.
print(rectangle["width"]) -- 50
```

We can also add properties when creating the table.

```lua
local rectangle = {
    x = 10,
    y = 20,
    width = 50,
    height = 120
}
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use any type of value as a table key. Yes, that includes functions and tables! Though you should probably keep it at numbers and strings.

### Pairs

We use `ipairs` for looping through a list table. We can use `pairs` for looping through an object table.

```lua
local rectangle = {}
rectangle.x = 10
rectangle.y = 20
rectangle.width = 50
rectangle.height = 120

for k, v in pairs(rectangle) do
    print(k, v)
end

-- Output:
-- width, 50
-- y, 20
-- height, 120
-- x, 10,
```

> [!WARNING]
> Though it's possible to use `pairs` for list tables as well, the order which you get the indexes is random. Because of this, you should always use `ipairs` for list tables.

## Usage

By using tables, we can store multiple items in a single variable. If we have multiple enemies in our game, we won't need to make a separate variable for each of them. We can store these enemies inside our table (and remove them when defeated).

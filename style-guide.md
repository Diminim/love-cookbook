To keep the quality of the cookbook consistent, it's imperative to have a consistent style guide for the whole project. This makes it much easier to read and write, especially for an open-source body of work with potentially dozens of contributors. This guide covers both code and the written word.

These decisions focus on **readability.** This book is a resource for all devs, including total beginners, so it's important to minimize obscurity, inconsistency, and gotchas.

# Writing
* [Write in plain English.](https://www.plainenglish.co.uk/how-to-write-in-plain-english.html) In short:
	* Keep your sentences short;
	* Prefer active verbs;
	* Use "you" and "we";
	* Use words that are appropriate for the reader;
	* Don't be afraid to give instructions;
	* Avoid nominalizations;
	* Use lists when appropriate.

# Code
* Indent all code blocks with 2 spaces. This makes it easier to read multiple levels of indentation, especially on a smaller screen.
```lua
-- Good:
function add_10(n)
  return n + 10
end

-- Bad:
function add_10(n)
	return n + 10
end

function add_10(n)
    return n + 10
end

function add_10(n)
 return n + 10
end
```
* Name all variables in `snake_case`, including functions. Reserve `PascalCase` for classes and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constant globals - although those are rare.
```lua
-- Good:
local NewClass = Class:extend()
local current_temperature = self:get_current_temperature()
_G.MAXIMUM_TEMPERATURE = 100
-- Bad:
local new_class = Class:extend()
local currentTemperature = self:getCurrentTemperature()
_G.maximumtemperature = 100
```
* Write comments as fully-formed sentences, with proper capitalizing and punctuation, to make them easier to read at a glance. Put a space before the start of the comment.
```lua
--this is a bad comment (kinda hard to read (its fine ig but could be better))
-- This is a better comment. It reads like a regular sentence.
```
* Avoid writing comments that just reinstate a line of code. Prefer comments that explain overarching concepts at a high level, explain some tricky or unintuitive operation, or clarify a decision.
```lua
-- Good:

-- The amount of spaces that're placed to the left and right of every line,
-- in pixels.
local horizontal_padding = 4

-- Bad:

-- The amount of padding to be applied horizontally.
local horizontal_padding = 4

-- Good:

-- Using the square of the progress gives a smoother easing curve than just
-- progress by itself.
self.distance = self.length * self.progress * self.progress

-- Bad:

-- Set distance to the current lenght times the current progress, squared.
self.distance = self.length * self.progress * self.progress

-- Good:

-- Set a new max temperature.
-- Since previously stored calculations become invalid when the max temperature
-- changes, this also clears the cache.
function self:set_max_temperature(new_max)
  self.max_temperature = new_max
  self:clear_cache()
end

-- Bad:

-- Set maximum_temperature, then clear the cache.
function self:set_max_temperature(new_max)
  self.max_temperature = new_max
  self:clear_cache()
end
```
* Prefer double-quotes instead of single-quotes. Single-quotes are OK if it makes the string more readable.
```lua
-- Good:
name = "John"
-- Bad:
name = 'John'
-- This is ok:
print('Between "do" or "die," the right choice is obvious.')
```
* Put whitespace around operators and after commas.
```lua
-- Good:
result = "The answer was: " .. tostring(a + b)
numbers = {1, 2, 3}
-- Bad:
result="The answer was: "..tostring(a+b)
numbers={1,2,3}
```
* Avoid putting whitespace around parentheses.
```lua
-- Good:
print(a + b)
print(results[1])
print_each({1, 2, 3})
-- Bad:
print (a + b)
print( a + b )
print(results[ 1 ])
print_each({ 1, 2, 3 })
```
* Avoid omitting parenthesis for functions that take string and table literals, as that makes it harder to tell where functions start and end - and obscures precedence rules.
```lua
-- Good:
local data = get_data("john") .. inspect({name, age, birthday})
-- Bad:
local data = get_data"john"..inspect{name, age, birthday}
```
